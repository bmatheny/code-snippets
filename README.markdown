# Introduction
This repository contains small code snippets that don't belong anywhere else.
Mostly stuff I would like backed up and version controlled. Not sure if these
are useful for anyone else.

## What's here?
 * [shell](http://github.com/bmatheny/Code-Snippets/tree/master/shell/) - Collection of shell utilities
 * [ruby](http://github.com/bmatheny/Code-Snippets/tree/master/ruby/) - Collection of ruby scripts
